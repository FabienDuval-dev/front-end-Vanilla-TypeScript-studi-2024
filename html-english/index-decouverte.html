                  Welcome to the official Olympic Games page, the premier event for the world's top athletes. Discover the sports that captivate millions of spectators with each edition, including soccer, basketball, and tennis.

                  Soccer

                  Soccer, known as the most popular sport globally, is played on a large rectangular field where two teams of eleven players each compete. The goal is to score the most goals by directing the ball into the opposing team's goal, primarily using the feet, but also other parts of the body except for the hands and arms.

                  Basketball

                  Basketball is played on a rectangular court with two teams of five players each, aiming to score points by throwing a ball through an elevated hoop affixed to a backboard at each end of the court. This fast-paced game is characterized by its intensity and dynamic movements, as well as sophisticated passing and shooting techniques.

                  Tennis

                  Tennis is a racquet sport played on a rectangular court divided by a net. Players, in singles or doubles, score points by striking a ball with their racquet so that the opponent cannot make a valid return. This sport is renowned for its elegance, intense duels, and technical precision.

                  Explore these disciplines and many more on our platform, where passion and performance meet to create unforgettable moments. The Olympic Games celebrate sporting excellence, fair play, and international unity through these historic competitions.
